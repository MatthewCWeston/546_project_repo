# 546_project_repo
A collection of code representing a CS546 project at the University of Illinois.

This repository, for the time being, consists of a pair of IPython notebooks. The notebook representing the environment module contains the code for loading a set of trained agents, observing their actions, along with a PDF representing the final project writeup, which explains and motivates the delivered code.

We additionally provide a trained speaker and listener agent, for evaluation purposes. Note that the pipeline herein is meant to be environment and communication format - agnostic, and should be applicable to other agent structures and environments with small or no changes. We are continually making improvements to facilitate this process.

Additional code can be furnished on request. My intention is to convert this project into a publishable paper, and the contents of this repo will likely change over the course of that process.
